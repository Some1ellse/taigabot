## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Discord
1. Create a Discord application and get your token
2. Invite the bot to your server
3. Ensure your Discord server is Community enabled, and create a forum channel for posts.

#### Proxy
1. Ensure there is some form of proxy between the bot and Taiga, so you can properly catch the webhook route.
- Nginx Proxy Manager is a good easy way to do this- https://nginxproxymanager.com/

2. Create a webhook on your Taiga project
  - set secret key (use your favorite method to generate one.)

```Secret Key Generation Examples:

openssl rand -base64 32

powershell -Command "[Convert]::ToBase64String((1..32 | % {Get-Random -Maximum 256}))"
or a random string generator of some kind.
